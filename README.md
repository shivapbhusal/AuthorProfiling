# AuthorProfiling
Author profiling and identification is a practical application of text mining. It involves training the classifier using the existing text with authorship information and using the classifier to identify the author of the new text. Different authors have different styles of writing, and the style can be distinguished based on the attributes such as length of sentences, noun-verb ratio, the frequency of certain words etc.

This project consits of two components: the Profiler Engine and the Classification Engine.
