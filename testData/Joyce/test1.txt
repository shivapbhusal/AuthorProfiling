Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was 
a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow 
that was down along the road met a nicens little boy 
named baby tuckoo. . , . 

His father told him that story : his father looked at him 
through a glass : he had a hairy face. 

He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road 
where Betty Byrne lived : she sold lemon platt. 

0, the mid rose blossoms 
On the little green place. 

He sang that song. That was his song. 

0, the green wothe hotheth. 

When you wet the bed, first it is warm then it gets 
cold. Ilis mother put on the oilsheet. That had the 
queer smell. 

His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She 

[1] 



played on the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to 
dance. He danced: 

Tralala lala, 
Tralala iralaladdy, 
Tralala lala, 
Tralala lala. 

Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older 
than his father and mother but Uncle Charles was older 
than Dante. 

Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with 
the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the 
brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante 
gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of 
tissue paper. 

The Vances lived in number seven. They had a dif- 
ferent father and mother. They were Eileen's father 
and mother. When they were grown up he was going to 
marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said : 

— 0, Stephen will apologise. 
Dante said: 

— 0, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his 
eyes. — : 

Pull out his eyes, 

Apologise, 

Apologise, 

Pull out his eyes. 

Apologise, 
Pull out his eyes, 
Pull out his eyes. 
Apologise.

The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All 
were shouting and the prefects urged them on with 
strong cries. The evening air was pale and chilly and 
after every charge and thud of the foot-ballers the 
greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey 
light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of 
his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to 
run now and then. He felt his body small and weak 
amid the throng of players and his eyes were weak and 
watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be 
captain of the third line all the fellows said. 

Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche 
was a stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number 
and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big 
hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blan- 
ket. And one day he had asked : 

— What is your name ? 

Stephen had answered : Stephen Dedalus. 
Then Nasty Roche had said: 

— What kind of a name is that? 

And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty 
Roche had asked : 

— What is your father ? 
Stephen had answered: 

— A gentleman. 

Then Nasty Roche had asked: 

— Is he a magistrate ? ^ 
He crept about from point to point on the fringe of 

his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands 
were bluish with cold. He kept his hands in the side 
pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round 
his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. 
One day a fellow had said to Cantwell : 

[3] 



— I 'd give you such a belt in a second. 
Cantwell had answered: 

— Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a 
belt. I'd like to see you. He'd give you a toe in the 
rump for yourself. 

That was not a nice expression. His mother had told 
him not to speak with the rough boys in the college. 
Nice mother ! The first day in the hall of the castle when 
she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to 
her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. 
But he had pretended not to see that she was going to 
cry. She was a nice mother but she was not so nice 
when she cried. And his father had given him two five- 
shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had 
told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, 
whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at 
the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with 
his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in the 
breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and 
mother on it. They had cried to him from the car, wav- 
ing their hands: 

— Good-bye, Stephen, goodbye! 

— Good-bye, Stephen, goodbye ! 

He W8is caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fear- 
ful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to 
look through the legs. The fellows were struggling and 
groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and 
stamping. Then Jack Lawton 's yellow boots dodged out 
the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after. He 
ran after them a little way and then stopped. It was 
useless to run on. Soon they would be going home for 
the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would 

[4] 



change the number pasted up inside his desk from sev- 
entyseven to seventysix. 

It would be better to be in the study hall than out 
there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there 
were lights in the castle. He wondered from which win- 
dow Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the haha 
and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the 
windows. One day when he had been called to the castle 
the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers ' slugs 
in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of 
shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and 
warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like some- 
thing in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. 
And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's 
Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were 
only sentences to learn the spelling from. 

Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey 
Where the abbots buried him. 
Canker is a disease of plants, 
Caricer one of animals. 

It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, 
leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sen- 
tences. He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next 
his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into 
the square ditch because he would not swop his little 
snuffbox for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the con- 
queror of forty. How cold and slimy the water had 
been ! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the 
scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting 
for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the 
fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had 

[5] 



such a lovely warm smell ! Dante knew a lot of things. 
She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was 
and what was the longest river in America and what 
was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. 
Father Amall knew more than Dante because he was a 
priest but both his father and Uncle Charles said that 
Dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman. And 
when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put 
up her hand to her mouth : that was heartburn. 
A voice cried far out on the playground : 

— All in! 

Then other voices cried from the lower and third 
lines : 

— All in! All in! 

The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and 
he went among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held 
the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give 
it one last : but he walked on without even answering the 
fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the pre- 
fect was looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan 
and said : 

— We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's 
suck. 

Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon 
Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie 
the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the pre- 
fect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. 
Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the 
Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by 
the chain after and the dirty water went down through 
the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down 
slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that : 
suck. Only louder. 

[6] 



To remember that and the white look of the lava- 
tory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two 
cocks that you turned and water came out : cold and hot. 
He felt cold and then a little hot : and he could see the 
names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer 
thing.
